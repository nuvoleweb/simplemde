## SimpleMDE

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nuvoleweb/simplemde.svg?branch=8.x-1.x)](https://travis-ci.org/nuvoleweb/simplemde)

Drupal integration for <a href="https://easy-markdown-editor.tk/">Easy Markdown Editor</a> (the maintained fork of SimpleMDE):

> A drop-in JavaScript textarea replacement for writing beautiful and understandable Markdown.
The WYSIWYG-esque editor allows users who may be less experienced with Markdown to use familiar toolbar buttons and shortcuts. In addition, the syntax is rendered while editing to clearly show the expected result. Headings are larger, emphasized words are italicized, links are underlined, etc. SimpleMDE was one of the first editors to feature both built-in autosaving and spell checking, we have switched to Easy Markdown Editor which is an actively maintained fork of SimpleMDE.
